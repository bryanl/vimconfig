h1. vim

h2. This thing is deprecated. I wouldn't use this if I were use. 

https://github.com/carlhuda/janus is a much better starting point these days.


this is my vim config.  i originally pulled it 
from here:

http://github.com/akitaonrails/vimfiles/tree/master

now it has morphed into something else.  it might not
work on windows or it might work well.  i don't know.


happy hacking!
